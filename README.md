Keeping track of all our Sales metrics is essential for boosting Sales and identifying underlying problems. Every metric in our Power BI Sales Dashboard should help us understand more about our company’s progress and it should also allows us to make quick and accurate business decisions.
In my analysis of the superstore dataset, I came to an understanding that the most challenging task of building a Sales Dashboard is understanding the specific goals we are trying to reach. One can start by identifying the key metrics to keep track of to ensure peak efficiency. 
The dashboard provides a variety of filters to drill down and up for different granularity. The users can also filter the visualizations in the dashboard by region, state, category of products, sub-categories, and customer segments. In this dashboard, superstore managers can see the total profit, total sales, and the total discount of each region, they can also see details of each state by simply drilling down to the state view in each chart. This allows them to plan for each region/state inventory based on the sales number to avoid the cost of warehousing. The order size chart depicts the distribution of items in each order. The business owners can see the popular shipping mode of their goods with a quick glance at the shipping modes chart. These two charts can help the business to optimize its dispatch and logistics accordingly. The sales chart is a valuable visualization that can provide an overall view of the sales amount of each state. Lately I have come to the realization that drill down and drill up make reporting practical and powerful simultaneously. Drill down and drill up are two influential features in business intelligence. They both offer a presenter the freedom to see information and data in data analytics tools. That’s especially true, even though they do so differently. 
The profit by category chart gives managers the ability to have a wide range of information in just one chart, by drilling up they can have information about the overall profit of each product category and by drilling down they can find the most valuable products and the slow-mover ones. This can help production to put their resources into producing profitable goods and perhaps stop the production of goods with little to no profit. The orders by quarter chart generate information about the number of orders in each quarter of the year.
